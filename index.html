        Recipe
    </H3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 to 5
            minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to the skillet. Add onions, garlic, and fresh ginger; cook and stir until
            onion is soft and golden. Add tomatoes, salt, cumin, chili powder, pepper, and turmeric; cook, stirring
            constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over
            low heat, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little
            hot water if mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.</li><br>
        <li>Add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45
            minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when chicken is finished cooking. If necessary
            cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li><br>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the rice: Wash rice well and drain in a colander for at least 30 minutes.
        </li><br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet. Add onion; cook and stir until golden. Add cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon
            stick, ground ginger, and saffron; stir in rice until coated with spices.</li><br>
        <li>Heat stock and salt in a medium pot until hot; pour over rice and stir well. Add chicken mixture and
            potatoes; stir gently to combine. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to very low, cover with a tight-fitting lid,
            and steam for 20 minutes without lifting the lid or stirring. Spoon biryani onto a warm serving dish.
